#Code Golf

##Rules
TBD

Make a folder named whatever you want (preferably your name) and put all your solutions in it. This is to avoid merge conflicts and so we know whose work is whose. You may further organize into problem folders.

The files must be called 1.py, 2.py, 3.py for the checker.py to recognize them as submissions

##Questions
1. print 'hello world' without using an 'o' or an 'i' in your source code
2. print 'hello world' without using any quotations in your source code
3. print the first 12 numbers of the fibonacci sequence, format "number1 number2 number3 ..."
